//----------------------------\\
it was fun testing out ideas on a dataset and see how it effects the predction, altought my accuracy was low on all 3 tests but for me it makes sense becuase am working on a single column that shuoldnt (by it slef) have so that much effect on the outcome 
i serached about doing the training / testing on 2 columns at the same time but it felt a little out of my league for now, 
over all it was a nice lab
